  <li><strong>Practice Schedule</strong> - chose Practice Schedule in the Type dropdown and select which install the practice schedule should belong to. Then click the Go to Install button. This will take you to the chosen install's page - the actual practice schedule will need to be generated from this page (see the Practice Schedules section below). Once the practice schedule is generated, it will be added to the calendar.  
  <li><strong>Script</strong> - chose Script in the Type dropdown and select which install the script should belong to. Then click the Go to Install button.

<hr class="light-blue">

<h3 class="bottom-padding">Play Database</h3>
<p>The play database allows you to save formation and play names. These saved names will then be available to you in the corresponding dropdown menu when adding a new play call to your installs.</p>

<strong>Saved Formations</strong>
<p class="bottom-padding">To add a new formation, click the Add a New Formation button. Enter the title of the formation and then click create. When adding a new play call to an install, the saved formations will show in the dropdown menu in the same order they are listed on this page - the order can be edited by clicking and dragging each formation to its desired position. You can edit the name of the formation or remove it by using the Update or Delete Formation button.</p>
<p></p>
<strong>Saved Plays</strong>
<p class="bottom-padding">The functionality of the Saved Plays is identical to that of the Saved Formations. To add a new play, click the Add a New Play button. Enter the title of the play and then click create. When adding a new play call to an install, the saved plays will show in the dropdown menu in the same order they are listed on this page - the order can be edited by clicking and dragging each play to its desired position. You can edit the name of the play or remove it by using the Update or Delete Play button.</p>

<hr class="light-blue">

<h3 class="bottom-padding">Installs</h3>
<p class="skinny">Once an install is created (following the directions in The Calendar section above), it can be accessed thru either the calendar or the navigation bar at the top of the screen. </p>
<p class="skinny">*Please note that the only special characters allowed in the titles of Plays, Practice Schedules, Scripts, and Game Call Sheets are "-", "_", "/", "&", "#", "@", “^”, and "$".</p>

<h4 class="bottom-padding">Play Calls</h4>
<p class="skinny">In Definite6, the play call is composed of two pieces: the formation and the play. Personnel groupings, motion, etc. can be included in either space depending on your needs/preferences.</p>
<p class="skinny">To add a new play call to the install, click the Add New Play button. This will show the Add a New Play window.</p>
<strong>Add a New Play</strong>

<ul>
  <li class=top-padding><strong>Formation and Play Name</strong> - The formation and play name can be typed into the appropriate fields. If you have entered formations or plays in your play database (see Play Database section below), you can click the Saved Formations & Plays button - this will display the Saved Formations and Saved Plays dropdowns. Your saved formations and plays can be chosen in the dropdown, saving you from repetitive typing.</li>
  <li><strong>Practice in Segment (for use with the standard practice script template)</strong> - if using the standard practice script template, each script contains up to four separate practice segments. Chose which segments you would like this play to be practiced in the next created script. This can be adjusted at any time, including in between creating different scripts. For more on the script templates, please see the Scripts section below.</li>
  
  <div class="top-bottom-padding"><strong>Assign Situation Info</strong> - click this button to show the situation info section. This information is used in the creation of Game Call Sheets.</div>

  <li><strong>Run/Pass</strong> - indicate whether the play is a run or a pass.</li>
  <li><strong>Hash</strong> - indicate which hash you would like the play to be run from.</li>
  <li><strong>Situations</strong> - chose which situation(s) you would like the play to be run in.</li>
</ul>

<p class="top-bottom">Once the desired information has been entered, click the Add Play to Install button. After each play is added, it will show on the install page forming a list. The list displays the play name, type, hash, and if using the standard practice script template, the practice segment(s) the play will be included in the next created script. 
</p>

<p class="skinny">In addition to the segments, the type and hash can be updated directly in the list – a dropdown arrow will appear when hovering over the play’s type or hash. Left click while the arrow is visible and a dropdown will appear where the type/hash can be updated. 
</p>

<p class="skinny">The order in which the plays are listed can be edited by clicking and dragging each play to its desired position. If two plays in the list have matching names, each will be highlighted in red (to help prevent accidental duplication).
</p>

<p class="skinny">Click on the play name to show the edit play screen. From the screen, you can update any of the attributes mentioned above, or remove the play from the install. Additionally, you can view the number of times the play has been repped (shows the number of times the play is included in all of the scripts created within that install).
</p>

  <li><strong>Update Multiple</strong> - update the attributes of multiple plays at one time. Select the plays to be updated and then select the attributes to update. Please note that if an attribute is checked, it will update regardless if a selection is made, e.g., if Update Openers is checked, but the Openers box is not, each selected play will now not be included in the Openers.</li>

</ul>

<span class="underline"><strong>Standard Template</strong></span><br>
The standard script template is the default template provided by Definite6. The standard script template is divided into four practice segments. Each of the four segments contain five columns. The H, D-D, and Defense columns can be used optionally.

<ul>
  <li><strong>#</strong> - each segment is composed of an ordered list - indicates the play's position in the list; there are spaces for up to 25 plays in each segment.
  <li><strong>H</strong> - hash mark; can chose "L", "M", or "R" thru the dropdown.
  <li><strong>D-D</strong> - down & distance; must be typed in.
  <li><strong>Formation & Play Call</strong> - the play; will auto populate based on the information provided for each play in the install. Additionally, each cell containing a play has a dropdown which allows you to select any of the plays currently included in the install. 
  <li><strong>Defense</strong> - defense; must be typed in.
</ul>

<span class="underline"><strong>Custom Template</strong></span><br>
The Custom Script Templates allow you to save your customizations, meaning they only need to be completed once. The Custom Script Templates can be edited in your Account Settings. Each user is given three separate templates. As with the actual script, right click after highlighting the desired cells to bring up the customization menu. From here you can not only set the style, but also add a dropdown menu to the cell(s). Choose a play from the plays dropdown menu to assign that cell to the corresponding play in your install, e.g., if Run Play 1 is entered into the cell in the template, the first run play on the current install will auto populate this cell when the script is created.

<br>

<h4 class="bottom-padding">Game Call Sheets</h4>
<p class="skinny">To generate a new game call sheet, click the Create New Game Call Sheet button. Enter the title, chose the desired template, and select the date.

<span class="underline"><strong>Standard Template</strong></span><br>
The game call sheet is two pages and contains sections for each of the 14 potential situations (including three custom situations which can be updated to fit your preferences). Each situation has a run and a pass section (excluding openers) and is divided into two columns. The left column represents left hash plays and the right column represents right hash plays. The plays will populate automatically based on the assigned situation info entered on the install page. Similar to the script, each cell in the game call sheet can be edited and each cell containing a play has a dropdown which allows you to select any of the plays currently included in the install. The title, color, and run/pass balance of each situation can be adjusted by clicking the Call Sheet Settings link in the Account Settings.

<br>
<br>

<span class="underline"><strong>Custom Template</strong></span><br>
Like the standard template, the custom template is also two pages, however you have total control over the sheet’s format. The custom template can be accessed by clicking the Custom Call Sheet Template link in the Account Settings. To make style updates, right click after highlighting the desired cell(s) to bring up the customization menu. Dropdown menus can also be added to each cell using this menu. Choose a play from the plays dropdown menu to assign that cell to the corresponding play in your install, e.g., if Sit 11 Run Lt Play 3 is entered into the cell in the template, the third situation 11 left hash run play on the current install will auto populate this cell when the call sheet is created. Each call sheet created using the custom template will follow the formatting set in the custom template.
